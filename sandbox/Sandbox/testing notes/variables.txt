//Variables
        //Variables must be declared with a type.
        //Variables types include: int, string, float, double, decimal, bool
        //"int - Integers (whole numbers, positive and negative)"
        //"string - Strings (a sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, or symbols)"
        //"float - Floating point numbers (numbers that use decimals)"

        Console.WriteLine("double - Double precision floating point numbers " + //Continue text on next line using "text" + "text" to 'add' the 2 strings together
         " (just like a float, except it takes up twice as much memory, so it can hold larger numbers or numbers with more decimal places) ");

        //"bool - Boolean variables (true or false) - boolean default when not declared is false


        //declaration
        Console.WriteLine("Declaration: DataType variableName = variableDeclaration Ex: string name = Donovan;");

        //2 lines of declaration and 
        int number;
        number = 2;

        //single line declaration
